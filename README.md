# Nilufer ANLAR,  ITMD-362 Project 2 --- MasterProj2

My self-critique memo of our project:
-------------------------------------
- Since I am both an online and remote student, I did not know any of my class mates at all. So, I did not want to start my own team due to both being online and remote, and also for usability testing.  
- After I joined to Daniel's team, it was not easy for us to find the third member. Some showed interest, but we were not impressed with their class work. A week after we started, Richard joined us.
- Our team faced two MAJOR challenges: 
  1. Our inexperience with Github GUI merges in/out cost us a lot of time and frustration. We somehow kept overriding each others changes in the CSS style file and I kept losing a lot of styling work, simply because I had more html pages. After I contacted our TA, Padhu, he was a great help for us, to make the first code delivery on time.
  2. Teamwork was NOT great: I wanted us to communicate frequently in short sessions. But both team members' very busy schedules and other responsibilities made the communication difficult. That resulted in misunderstandings and unequal distribution of work. Team members volunteered for their portion of the work, but it was not a good distribution, as I realized later.
- Due to the above challenges, the quality of our project did not turn out to be that good, unfortunately. 
  
A personal note on teamwork: Since I was involved in many years of doing iterative/lean development in scrums in corporate environments, I expected similar type of communication and responsiveness from our team. I soon realized that the academic/student responsiveness and accountability were quite different than what I used to :). 
  
My progress in class to this point:
-----------------------------------
I discovered that ITMD-361 class was a prerequisite for this class after I started taking this class while taking ITMD-361 simultaneously 
(TAA program that I am in did not allow me to change my schedule, unfortunately). So I ended up putting more time to this class than I originally anticipated. Even though I learned quite bit, I wish I'd taken ITMD-361 before, not at the same time.
Therefore, I feel like I did not get enough out of this class.
